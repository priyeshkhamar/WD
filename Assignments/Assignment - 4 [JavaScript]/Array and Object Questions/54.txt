Q - 54. Form Validtion in JS?
Ans.

Form validation in JavaScript is the process of verifying data in HTML forms to ensure it meets specific criteria, preventing security vulnerabilities, and enhancing user experience. 
It is typically done using client-side scripting, providing immediate feedback on input errors, thereby reducing the chances of incorrect submission.


Some common form validation approaches and features in JavaScript are:

1. Required Fields: Ensure that all necessary form fields are completed before submission.


2. Data Format Validation: Ensuring that input data adheres to certain forms, such as email addresses, phone numbers, dates, or numerical quantities.

3. Length Constraints: Verifying the length of input values to make sure minimum and maximum character limits.

4. Number and Textual constraints: Validating input using number ranges, character sets, or acceptable text patterns.

5. Error Messaging: Sending informative error messages to users that indicate validation issues and instruct them on how to correct their input.
