Q - 60. Array vs object differences in JS?
Ans.

n JavaScript, arrays and objects are both commonly used data structures, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
Following are the key differences between arrays and objects in JavaScript:

1. Purpose :
Arrays: 
- Store ordered collections of values.
- Used for manipulating similar items like numbers or strings.

Objects:
- Store collections of key-value pairs.
- Suitable for representing structured data and modeling real-world entities.

2. Declaration :
Arrays: 
- Arrays are declared using square brackets ([]) and can contain any number of elements separated by commas.

Objects: 
- Objects are declared using curly braces ({}) and consist of key-value pairs separated by commas. The key is always a string, and the value can be of any data type.

3. Accessing Elements:
Arrays: 
- Elements accessed by numerical index, using square brackets or array methods.

Objects: 
- Properties accessed by keys, using dot notation or square brackets notation.
- Object methods like Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() can be used.

4. Order:

Arrays: 
- Arrays maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. The order of elements in an array is determined by their indices.
Objects: 
- Object properties are not ordered. The order in which properties are defined in an object may not be preserved, and properties may be enumerated in a different order in different JavaScript engines.
