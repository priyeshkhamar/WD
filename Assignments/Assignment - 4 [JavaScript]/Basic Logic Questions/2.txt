Ans.

There are 3 types of variables in JavaScript: 
(i)	Var
	In this type, a variable can be defined as: var a = 10, where a is the variable_name and the value assigned to it is 10.
Var type supports Declaration, Re-Declaration as well as Re-assignment of variable.

(ii)	Let
	In this type, a variable can be defined as: let a = 10, where a is the name of variable and 10 is the assigned value.
Let supports Declaration and Re-Assignment but does not support Re-Declaration.
(iii)	Constant
	In this type, a variable can be defined as: const a = 10, where a is the variable name and 10 is the assigned value.
Const is unique and does not support Re-declaration or Re-assignment.
The value is constant throughout.
