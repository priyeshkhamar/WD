Q - 18. What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?
Ans.

>>Loops 
The JavaScript loops are used to iterate a piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops.
It makes the code compact.
It is mostly used in array.

There are four types of loops in JavaScript.

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for-in loop

1. For Loop
--> The for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. 

Syntax :

for (initialization; condition; increment)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  


2. While Loop
--> The while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known.

Syntax :

while (condition)  
{  
    code to be executed  
    increment
} 


3. Do-while Loop
--> The do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false.

Syntax :

do{  
    code to be executed  
}while (condition);  

4. For in Loop
--> The JavaScript for in loop is used to iterate the properties of an object. 




>>Switch Case 
As the number of conditions increases, you can use multiple else-if statements. But when we have to deal with
many conditions, the switch statement is used.

Syntax:

switch (expression) {
case value1:
statement1;
break;
case value2:
statement2;
break;
. . .
case valueN:
statementN;
break;
default:
statementDefault;
};
