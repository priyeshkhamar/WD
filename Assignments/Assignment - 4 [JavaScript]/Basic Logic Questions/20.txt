Q -20. What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?
Ans.

1. Logical AND (&&):

Syntax: expression1 && expression2

The && operator returns true if both expression1 and expression2 are true. If either one of them is false, the result is false.

Example :

var result = (5 > 3 && 2 < 4); // Result is true because both conditions are true


2. Logical OR (||):

Syntax : expression1 || expression2

The || operator returns true if at least one of expression1 or expression2 is true. If both are false, the result is false.

Example : 

var result = (5 > 3 || 2 > 4); // Result is true because at least one condition is true
