Q - 21. What is the use of Void (0)?
Ans.

The void(0) expression is often used in JavaScript to prevent the browser from navigating to a new page when clicking on a link or button. It essentially creates a "no-operation" expression that evaluates to undefined, while ensuring that the browser's current page remains unchanged.

Example :
<a href="javascript:void(0)">Click Me</a>

In this example, clicking the "Click Me" link won't cause the browser to navigate anywhere because void(0) returns undefined.
