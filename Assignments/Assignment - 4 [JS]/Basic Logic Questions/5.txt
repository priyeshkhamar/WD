Q - 5. What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?
Ans.

1. Undefine 
--> A variable is said to be "undefined" when it has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

Example : 
let x; // Declaration without assignment, x is undefined
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

2. Undeclared 
--> A variable is "undeclared" when it is used without being previously declared using var, let, or const.

Example :
console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined (undeclared)

To summarize,
"Undefined" refers to a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
"Undeclared" refers to a variable that has been used without being declared.
