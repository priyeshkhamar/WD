Q - 1. What is JavaScript. How to use it?
Ans.

JavaScript is a client-side scripting language which defines the behaviour of a webpage.

There are two ways to use JavaScript in a webpage:
(i)	Internal
--> We can write the JS code within the <script> tag inside the <head> or the <body> part.

(ii)	External
--> We can integrate an external JS file using <script src = “script.js”>.
