Q-3. Define a Data Types in JS?
Ans.

In programming, data type is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, we need to know what type of data it is. 

There is main 2 types of Data types: 
(i)	Primitive
(ii)	Non-Primitive

(i)	Primitive data types
There are further 7 types of primitive data types:
1.	Number – include all the numbers, integers.
2.	String - A string (or a text string) is a series of characters.
3.	Boolean - Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

4.	BigInt - All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.
JavaScript BigInt is a data type that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

5.	Undefined - In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

6.	Null

7.	Symbols – Special characters are stored as symbols.
(ii)	Non-Primitive data types
1.	Array – 
Arrays are multiple values stored in a single variable.
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
Array items are separated by commas.
a [car, bike, scooter]

2.	Objects 
JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
Object properties are written as name: value pairs, separated by commas.
