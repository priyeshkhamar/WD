<!-- Q - 9.  What is Condition Statement? -->
Ans :
JavaScript Conditional statements allow you to execute specific code based on conditions. 
If the condition meets then a particular block of code will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of code that
satisfies that particular condition.

Types of Conditional statements :

1. If statement
--> The if statement is used to evaluate a particular condition. If the condition holds true, the associated code block is
executed.

Syntax:

if ( condition ) {
// If the condition is met,
//code will get executed.
}

2. if-else Statement
--> The if-else statement will perform some code for a specific condition. 
The else statement is written after the if statement and it has no condition in their code block.

Syntax:

if (condition1) {
// Executes when condition1 is true
if (condition2) {
// Executes when condition2 is true
}
}

3. else if Statement
--> The else if statement in JavaScript allows handling multiple possible conditions and outputs, evaluating more than two
conditions based on whether the conditions are true or false.

Syntax:

if (1st condition) {
// Code for 1st condition
} else if (2nd condition) {
// ode for 2nd condition
} else if (3rd condition) {
// Code for 3rd condition
} else {
// code that will execute if all
// above conditions are false
}

4. Using Switch Statement (JavaScript Switch Case)
--> As the number of conditions increases, you can use multiple else-if statements. But when we have to deal with
many conditions, the switch statement is used.

Syntax:

switch (expression) {
case value1:
statement1;
break;
case value2:
statement2;
break;
. . .
case valueN:
statementN;
break;
default:
statementDefault;
};
