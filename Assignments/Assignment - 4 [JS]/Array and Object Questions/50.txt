Q - 50. What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?
Ans.

Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects have a chance to increase memory usage and result in code duplication, particularly if the object is used many times.

Furthermore, updating a method for every instance of an object would require you to make changes later, which may be time-consuming and prone to mistakes.

Using classes in JavaScript allows you to declare methods once and distribute them across all instances of the object. 
This decreases memory utilization and also simplifies code maintenance and updates.
